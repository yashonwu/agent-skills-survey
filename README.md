# Agent Skills Survey Web Page

This repository includes a standalone HTML page (`index.html`) that presents the Agent Skills survey content as a web page. It features:

- Title, authors, and contact information
- Abstract and keywords
- Figures and tables (images)
- Slides embedded with a PDF preview
- An introduction video (MP4)
- A LaTeX/BibTeX reference block
- Footer attribution text

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the page. All media assets are local files in the same folder, so the page works offline.
